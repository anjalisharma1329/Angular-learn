<!-- 
Before you start adding any code to your project, let's first understand the project's anatomy. These are the files and folders contained in the project:

/e2e/: This folder contains end-to-end (simulating user behavior) tests of the website.

/node_modules/: All 3rd party libraries are installed to this folder using npm install.

/src/: It contains the source code of the application. Most work will be done here.

/app/: It contains modules and components.

/assets/: It contains static assets like images, icons and styles etc.

/environments/: It contains environment (production and development) specific configuration files.

browserslist: Needed by autoprefixer for CSS support.

favicon.ico: The favicon.

index.html: The main HTML file.

karma.conf.js: The configuration file for Karma (a testing tool)

main.ts: The main starting file from where the AppModule is bootstrapped.

polyfills.ts: Polyfills needed by Angular.

styles.css: The global stylesheet file for the project.

test.ts: This is a configuration file for Karma

tsconfig.*.json: The configuration files for TypeScript.

angular.json: It contains the configurations for CLI

package.json: It contains basic information of the project (name, description and dependencies etc.)
README.md: A Markdown file that contains a description of the project.

tsconfig.json: The configuration file for TypeScript.

tslint.json: The configuration file for TSlint (a static analysis tool)

You can configure many aspects of your project from the angular.json file. And most of the work you will do will be in the src/app folder that contains the actual code of your application.

You can also define any environment variables inside the src/environments folder.
